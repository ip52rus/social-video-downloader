# Task Decomposition

## Foundation
- [x] Create GitHub repository.
- [x] Establish README.
- [x] Establish AGENTS.md.
- [x] Establish Git ignore and environment example.
- [x] Document product definition.
- [x] Document architecture.
- [x] Document roadmap.
- [x] Document security, development, and testing policies.
- [x] Add CI.
- [x] Add dependency management.

## Downloader Core
- [x] Define domain models.
- [x] Define provider interface.
- [x] Define platform-independent download modes and quality options.
- [x] Extend provider contract for mode and quality discovery.
- [x] Implement URL normalization.
- [x] Implement platform detection.
- [x] Implement safe filename generation.
- [x] Implement temporary workspace lifecycle.
- [x] Define error taxonomy.
- [x] Add unit tests for models, errors, provider contract, URL handling, filenames, and workspace lifecycle.
- [x] Add integration harness.

## YouTube — Phase 2 acceptance gate passed
- [x] Move the YouTube provider implementation into the provider architecture.
- [x] Smoke-test metadata extraction and downloads with public videos.
- [x] Validate Shorts with real downloads in all three modes.
- [x] Validate a representative live output-mode/container matrix on a regular public video.
- [x] Validate deterministic provider error boundaries and representative format layouts.

### Recorded verification evidence
- Live matrix run on 2026-10-09 for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ: 1 passed in 140.06s.
- The live test downloaded combined video/audio MP4, selected-quality video-only, and audio-only outputs in two distinct containers. ffprobe verified stream composition, codecs, dimensions, sample rate, and expected containers.
- Shorts were tested in all three modes; additional successful Shorts smoke tests were recorded for VF_MOfnz7OY and osrN3A_Rdiw.
- The duplicate audio format ID issue was reproduced and fixed. Deterministic tests cover provider errors, cleanup, and representative format layouts.
- GitHub Actions run [37966225469](https://github.com/ip52rus/social-video-downloader/actions/runs/37966225469) passed 131 tests and Ruff lint/format checks on merge commit f27051fded257b5f39056c45333b4fa8c50075a3.

The Phase 2 gate is satisfied by the combined live matrix and deterministic failure-boundary coverage. Scope limitation: the live matrix was run against one regular public video, not every YouTube format or platform condition.

## Telegram MVP — in progress
- [x] Add validated environment-based application settings and deterministic tests.
- [x] Configure standard-library application logging and add an aiogram bot/dispatcher polling entry point.
- [x] Test logging configuration and bot/dispatcher construction without Telegram API calls.
- [x] Implement /start and text-based URL intake with supported-platform recognition and safe user-facing validation responses.
- [x] Add deterministic handler tests for /start, valid YouTube/Instagram/TikTok URLs, invalid links, and unsupported domains.
- [x] Connect URL normalization and provider selection through the transport-independent DownloadService.
- [x] Add deterministic tests for YouTube handler orchestration, safe domain-error responses, file delivery calls, and temporary workspace cleanup; CI passed.
- [ ] Perform a manual test-bot end-to-end flow for a public YouTube URL, confirm the uploaded file is playable, and check upload-limit/failure behavior.
- [ ] Document the full test-bot setup and end-to-end run.

The automated checks for the provider-selection and mocked Telegram download/delivery flow passed in [GitHub Actions run 37974061474](https://github.com/ip52rus/social-video-downloader/actions/runs/37974061474). This verifies deterministic behavior only; the real Telegram end-to-end acceptance gate remains open. Instagram and TikTok links are recognized but their download providers are not implemented.

## Access control — separate Phase 4
- [ ] Define required Telegram community.
- [ ] Implement membership check.
- [ ] Test member, non-member, leave, and rejoin behavior.
- [ ] Fail closed on membership-check errors where appropriate.
