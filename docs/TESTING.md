# Testing Strategy

## Unit tests
Fast deterministic tests for URL normalization, provider detection, filename sanitization, configuration parsing, and error mapping.

## Integration tests
Provider metadata extraction, media download, video/audio merging, and temporary workspace cleanup. External tests must not require personal credentials.

## End-to-end tests
Use only where they provide meaningful coverage, including Telegram URL submission, access control, delivery, and failure handling.

## Quality gates
A phase cannot be marked complete only because the happy path works. Relevant negative cases and resource/error boundaries must be covered.

## External platforms
Distinguish application regressions, provider/platform changes, and temporary network failures. Record external changes before modifying unrelated code.
